Want to settle an argument about what region of the UK somewhere is in?

https://fallax.github.io/voronoi-regions/ to the rescue!

The most populous urban areas of the UK are used as points to create a [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram). In other words, we split the UK up into areas based on what their closest big city is. We colour these areas based on what region we think that means you are in.

So:

- nearer to Coventry than Leicester? You're in the West Midlands (green). 
- Nearer to Leicester than Coventry? You're in the East Midlands (blue).

If there aren't any big cities nearby - like in the Scottish Highlands or Mid-Wales - the biggest nearby town is used instead.
