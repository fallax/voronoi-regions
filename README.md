Want to settle an argument about what region of the UK somewhere is in?

https://fallax.github.io/voronoi-regions/ to the rescue!

The most populous urban areas of the UK are used as points to create a [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram). In other words, we split the UK up into areas based on what their closest big city is. If there isn't one nearby - like in the Scottish Highlands or Mid-Wales - the biggest nearby town is used instead. Finally, these regions are coloured to give a rough idea of region of the UK.
